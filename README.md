## Usage

The server provides a `render` tool that can:
- Take screenshots in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, MP4 and more)
- Convert pages to HTML, markdown
- Extract metadata and cookies
- Save files locally to your downloads with `store_renders: true`

Claude will automatically use this when you ask it to screenshot websites or convert web content.
